<h3>When it all began</h3>
<p>Climbing has been a hobby of mine for 4 years now. I first started when I first came to Luther, freshman year. A friend of mine had convinced me to it out. First time around I failed dismally, but I never gave up, I came back time and time again. Inching closer to my goal with every day!</p>
<p>Today I am part of a close group of climbing friends, we all climb and work to improve our climbing. It is great having a group of friends to push you further and egg you on.</p>
<p>I have decided to dedicate this web page to climbing things, and include a few things that will demonstrat way climbing is so much fun!</p>
<h3>Best Rewards</h3>

<p> The feeling of achievment you get at the end of every climb, when you hit that finish and stand on a cliff face gaving out at the section of the world you just concured PRICELESS!</p>
<h3>Climbing with Friends</h3>

<p>Climbing is not a lonley sport, we never climb alone. One because it is not very safe, If you fall and get hurt alone you could have a serious problem, like the movie 127 hour, if you dont know what that is <a herf=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OlhLOWTnVoQ>here</a> is a link to the trailer.</p>
<p>The second reason is that it is not very fun if you make this crazy sick move and no one is there to see it. Like how sad is it to make this crazy move, celabrate and no one else see's it.<img hieght="50" width="50" src=http://assets.diylol.com/hfs/ae1/93d/019/resized/sad-x-all-the-y-meme-generator-no-pal-008123.jpg></p>
<h3>Great Workout</h3>

<p>CLimbing is an amazing full body workout, that everyone can do. The reason for that is because no matter how strong you are some things are impossable to to with just your arms. Climbing forces you to use your core to balance, will pushing with your legs and pulling with your arms. Your back and shoulders work overtime too.</p>
<h4>In the End</h4>
<p>In the end climbing is not just a hobbie it becomes a way of life, one that I recoment you consider </p>
